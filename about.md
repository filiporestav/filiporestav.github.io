# 👋 About me

Hi! I’m **Filip Orestav**, a student passionate about the intersection of **machine learning**, **technology**, and real-world impact.

Right now, I'm on exchange at the **University of Queensland**, taking the course **ELEC4630 – Computer Vision and Deep Learning**, while also exploring the brilliant world of **fast.ai**. This blog is a space where I reflect on what I learn, share experiments, and document the rabbit holes I fall into.

## 🚀 Why this blog?

When I started this course, I wanted to do more than just submit assignments. I wanted to *understand* things deeply and be able to explain them clearly — both to others and to my future self.

This blog helps me:
- Think out loud 💭  
- Track my progress 📈  
- Make sense of confusing concepts 🤯  
- Share cool insights and challenges I run into 💡  

If someone else finds this useful, that's a bonus.

## 🛠️ Tools I currently use

- **fastai** – for easy model building and experimentation  
- **PyTorch** – for going a bit deeper when needed  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – for exploratory work and documentation  
- **OpenCV** – for image processing and fun computer vision projects  
- **GitHub** – for keeping everything organized (and public when allowed to 😅)

## 🎯 Interests

Outside the classroom, I’m really into:
- Applied AI and its role in business and decision-making  
- Making things as simple as possible (but not simpler)  
- Startups, investing, and seeing how tech transforms industries  
- Traveling and experiencing nature — recently backpacked New Zealand 🇳🇿
