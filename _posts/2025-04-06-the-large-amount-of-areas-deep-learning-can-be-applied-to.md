# The large amount of areas deep learning can be applied to
During the fastai course, I have realized the unmarkable power of deep learning (DL). The idea of designing a type of "thinking" similar to human's brain, and optimizing the training process, with the help of math and computations make the field very generalizable. 

## Examples of areas
Some areas where deep learning can be applied to are:
* **Vision:** A very interesting area. Most people think that a vision model only can recognize images. While that is true, a lot of things can be represented as images. Thus, an image recogniser can learn many different tasks. For example, time series data can be converted into an image by plotting it on a graph, or sound data can be converted into a spectrogram and plotted. See the example below, where a fastai studen used that approach to beat a state-of-the-art model. ![sound spectrogram](images/sound-spectrogram.png) The possibilities of this are large, and there is just creativity and some experience of conversion to images that makes it challenging. It has actually received very good results for fraud analytics (by detecting users' mouse movements and mouse clicks), as well as malware classification (see [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324175499_Malware_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks)). DL can also segment things like car signs, vehicle registration numbers, humans, etc. in pictures, which has enabled robots and self-driving cars to name a few. With deep learning, we do not have to hard-code code for segmentation, which makes it a very bad general detector.
* **Natural Language Processing:** This is a very relevant area to today's AI hype. Today's generative AI is built using a deep learning architecture called Transformers. This has a large amount of use cases and computers can now generate text, automatically translate languages between each other, analyze text, label words in sentences, correct typos, etc. This is widely used in the industry today, for example for customer service, sentiment analysis and spam detection.
